üéâ You created a branch!

Creating a branch allows you to make modifications to your project without changing the deployed main branch. Now that you have a branch, it‚Äôs time to create a file and make your first commit!

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.

1.Create a new file on this branch, in a _posts folder called 0000-01-02-Arathy99.md. You can do so using this shortcut or manually as follows:
  Return to the "Code" tab
  In the branch drop-down, select "my-slide"
  Click Create new file
  In the "file name" field, type _posts/0000-01-02-Arathy99.md. Entering the / in the filename will automatically place your file in the _posts directory.
2.When you‚Äôre done naming the file, add the following content to your file:
---
layout: slide
title: "Welcome to our second slide!"
---
Your text
Use the left arrow to go back!
3.After adding the text, you can commit the change by entering a commit message in the text-entry field below the file edit view. For guidelines on commit messages, check out the Commits 101 drop-down, just above these instructions
